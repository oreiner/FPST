This is a slightly modified version of the VBA toolbox, mostly of the file demo_QlearningAsymetric.m, to adapt it the formatting of my log files and to the Q-learning model I choose to use.

## What is the VBA toolbox?

Most models of neurobiological and behavioral data can be broken down into processes that evolve over time and static observation mappings. Given these evolution and observation mappings, the toolbox can be used to simulate data, perform statistical data analysis, optimize the experimental design, etc... In brief, the toolbox provides:

* plug-and-play tools for classical statistical tests
* a library of computational models of behavioral and neurobiological data time series
* quick and efficient probabilistic inference techniques for parameter estimation and model comparison (+ experimental design optimization)
* graphical visualization of results (+ advanced diagnostics of model inversion)
